							<h1>Project Idea</h1>
							<h2>Overview</h2>
							<p>We will be creating an augmented reality role playing game (AR RPG) known as life quest, the focus of this game is to encourage people to exercise using in game quests and events to push people to leave the house and exercise. The game will allow users to create their own characters and explore the real world for quests and loot while interacting with other players.</p>
							<h2>Motivation</h2>
							<p>Video games can have major ramifications on health If not played in moderation and balanced with daily workouts and exercise. We want to help gamers balance their gaming and exercise into one compelling video game that allows the user to complete quests to earn in game items and loot. A game like this is constantly evolving as we have the world as our canvas to create and develop this video game.</p>
							<h2>Characters</h2>
							<p>Life Quest has various classes that the user can choose when creating their character at the beginning of the game. There are 4 main classes to choose from Mage, White mage, Fighter and Warrior. Each class will have different abilities and roles when engaging in combat. There are items that are tailored to each class, that give specific stat boosts based on the type of item.</p>
							<h3>Mage</h3>
							<p>The mage class is a damage dealing class (DPS) that uses mana to cast spells and use abilities. The mage uses weapons such as staffs, spell tomes and magic orbs, these types of weapons deal magic damage and usually give the character a mana boost when they are equipped. The gear they use is ‘cloak’ armour, which gives increased magic damage and mana but only has a little amount of armour protection.</p>
							<h3>White Mage</h3>
							<p>The White mage class is a healing class that focuses on using mana to cast healing and protective spells to party members and themselves. They have some magic damage abilities although they deal less damage compared to mages. They use similar weapons to mages but instead the items give a large increase in healing and mana, but only a small increase in magic damage. They use ‘cloak armour, which gives an increase in healing and mana, but very little armour protection.</p>
							<h3>Fighter</h3>
							<p>The fighter class is a DPS class that uses stamina to use abilities. Their abilities and attacks to physical damage as they use weapons like brass knuckles, boxing gloves and their bare hands. These weapons give increased physical damage to their abilities. The gear they use is light armour, which gives a boost to physical damage and gives a good amount of armour protection.</p>
							<h3>Warrior</h3>
							<p>The Warrior class is a DPS or Tank class that uses stamina to use abilities and attacks. This class uses weapons such as a great sword, sword and shield, axes and dual wielding one handed weapons. If the users chooses the sword and shield weapon they character can become a tank but they can also choose to use other weapons to become a DPS. The warrior uses heavy armour, to gain an increase in health (HP), physical damage and a great amount of armour protection.</p>
							<h2>Gameplay</h2>
							<p>The app will contain a virtual map that will mimic what the user sees in real life, however will contain elements of an RPG game, such as specific locations that the user can interact with to get quests, occasional random encounters with virtual enemies, random events that the user can participate in and random items that the user can pick up and add to their inventory. These specific locations will be mapped to real life landmarks, similar to pokestops in pokemon go, and may change throughout the year as the users visit locations with more frequency. The game will also have a series of quests that make up a main storyline, these quests will require the user to go to certain locations and complete certain tasks to advance. The game will also contain dungeons at some of the landmark locations in which the user will fight through a series of enemies followed by a final boss, in order to gain a reward after defeating them.</p>
							<h2>Combat</h2>
							<p>Turn based combat in which each character is given a chance to use one of 6 abilities which have various effects depending on the class of the character. These abilities are upgradable and new abilities can be unlocked as the character is leveled up. Some abilities will be class specific and some will be usable by multiple, or all classes.</p>
							<h2>Quests</h2>
							<p>There are quests that can be done at home, at the gym or at the park. There will be quests specifically catered for each location. In the gym, there will be a hardware that is used to help track the user’s heart rate. As for the users who couldn’t attend the gym, either because they couldn’t afford it or their gym is still closed, there will be quests for the park and at home as well. We will be collaborating with a fitness application to help track the user’s heart rate, whether the user is at home or elsewhere. As for the story, the story will have to be an open ended quest and for the users to continue the story of the game, they will need to be in a certain level, in order for them to progress through the game’s story, so as a result, they would need to do exercises to help them reach that certain level. Users will also encounter random enemies or random people who need materials, such as food or supplies, when they are not doing any quests and after the user has done it, they will be rewarded with in-game currency and materials, that will help the user’s journey. Users can also team up with other players to tackle big enemies or a large group of enemies in a dungeon-style scenario or the user can tackle the enemies by themselves, if they are confident. 	Similar to the random encounters, the user will be rewarded after they are done, but the rewards will be much better, if they are successful. There will also be a weekly quest that will require the user to walk some amount of kilometers and will provide different rewards depending on how far the user has traveled, however this will use the built in pedometer on all phones that this app will be available on to ensure that the user has actually walked, instead of just traveling by car or train.</p>
							<h2>Multiplayer</h2>
							<p>Users will be able to create party’s of up to 10 people who will be able to work collaboratively on completing dungeons and quests. Working as part of a party will give each member of the party certain bonuses, such as increased experience gain to level up their characters, however it will also increase the difficulty of dungeons, as they should be completable without a party and therefore would need to be more difficult with multiple people working together. Furthermore, there will be a player versus player mode in which players can compete using their characters against other players' characters, to gain rewards for whoever is successful in the battle. Players can also form clubs with other players and if a player teams up with another player to take on bosses or do challenges together, they will earn more rewards than if the player does it solo.</p>
							<h2>Tools and technologies</h2>
							<p>Our group obviously doesn’t have any knowledge with creating a game like this, so we would be using an AR kit that can help us create the game that we want, application such as Augmented Reality for Apple and ARCore overview for Android and unfortunately, our application will be Android or IOS exclusive, if we want to release the game, but hopefully, we can bring more players to come in and hopefully, we can be able to expand our resources and hopefully, we will not have to make our game exclusive to a certain market.</p>
							<h2>Skills</h2>
							<p>According to the website, oursourceworld.com, we would need 7 skills to create an AR RPG game. One skill we need is problem solving skills. This is a skill that requires us to figure out a problem with our game and figure a way on how to solve it. Another skill that we need is Augmented Reality SDK skill. This skill will let us design our fundamental infrastructures. 3D Gaming skill is another skill that we will need. The most important skill is Graphic Designing skill and this skill will let us design the backgrounds, markers etc. This skill will help create a good user design experience for everyone.</p>
							<h2>Outcome</h2>
							<p>If our project becomes successful, we would like to expand the game further and add more of what people like about our game, as well as, improve some of the features of the game to increase our player base and bring more enjoyment to our game. In order for us to expand our game, we would need to talk to governments and people who have knowledge on their city, so that we can bring more people into our game without worrying about the safety of the users, because we would have to prioritize the safety of users before releasing our game to them. As mentioned before, we would like to expand the user’s experience more for the game and one way we can do that is by adding more features to the game. Have more challenges for the players, have more bosses for the players to fight, have more characters for the characters to unlock and much more. All of these are things that we would like to add to the game, if we can reach enough players to keep support for the game going and we hope the game that we will be creating can do so.</p>
