							<h1>IT Technologies</h1>
							<h1>Machine learning</h1>
							<h2>What does it do? What technological developments make this possible?</h2>
							<p>Machine learning is the technology behind making machines learn. This is achieved by creating algorithms that automatically improve through experience. So effectively this means that a computer will attempt a task over and over again, essentially brute forcing it until it finds the best possible way to complete that task, in effect, learning from the experience of doing the task over and over again. An example of this is the system known as AlphaZero, developed by Deepmind, which taught itself how to play chess, shogi and go from scratch, and became as skilled as many leading programs designed specifically for those games. It took AlphaZero around 4 hours of playing itself at chess for it to be at a similar level to the leading chess engine at the time, stockfish. This learning is achieved by AlphaZero playing itself at chess over millions of games, first playing randomly, then making note of strategies that work and using them over and over again, to find refutations and other strategies that are effective. The techniques of AlphaZero were so effective that many conventionally chess engines have since adopted similar machine learning strategies, alongside their conventional methods to increase their strength. Machine learning is possible now as a result of increasingly powerful computers that have the power to run millions of simulations of for example, chess games, very very quickly. This allows computers to learn things much quicker than they have in the past. Machine learning is an integral part of artificial intelligence, as it allows computers to learn how to do new things, which is a defining aspect of intelligence. The future of machine learning is to create a system that can learn to do any task, given enough time. To achieve this, machine learning models will need to become more refined and efficient, so that they use as little computing power as possible, as this means that the computer can do tasks more quickly and therefore learn more quickly. This idea of a universal learning system is why the AlphaZero system is so impressive, being able to learn chess, shogi and go. Admittedly, these are all fairly similar, but most machine learning applications at the moment are only able to focus on one application. As computers grow increasingly more powerful into the future, machine learning systems will only become more effective, as they will be able to utilise the increased power to learn more quickly and therefore become even more proficient at their tasks. Additionally, machine learning systems will have to become more like human learning, as currently machine learning requires large datasets for the machine to analyse and determine what the best course of action is. However humans are able to learn from small datasets, as we can estimate outcomes given a relatively small dataset. Humans are able to do this, as we can recognise similarities between different tasks, whereas a machine learning system that has only learned one task, has no other tasks to look for similarities from and therefore cannot quickly apply techniques from one task to another. Another example of what can be done with machine learning comes from social media sites such as instagram and twitter. These companies use machine learning to determine what they should show users in the ‘explore’ sections of their apps. They do this by having machines examine keywords and phrases that a user seems interested in, and effectively learn what the user wants to see. Then they use these collected keywords to find matching content, and display it to the user. This kind of machine learning is also used to show users targeted advertisements, by analysing what the user has been looking at and showing them related advertisements.<p>
							<h2>What is the likely impact? </h2>
							<p>Machine learning has the potential to have a huge impact on the world. It is effectively a way for machines to learn any task, and with the help of robotics and other technologies, machine learning could effectively replace most human jobs. For example, machine learning is a major part of how autonomous vehicles will work in the near future, and autonomous vehicles will have a major effect on everyone. Machine learning has the capability to replace any task where an action is performed repeatedly, such as making a burger at a fast food restaurant. This will affect people who work menial jobs, such as factory workers or shelf stackers at supermarkets, as their jobs will be made redundant.  However machine learning will also create jobs, as once its widespread use is adopted, machine learning experts will be in high demand, to ensure that the systems work effectively and to solve any issues that may occur. Furthermore, machine learning applications are likely to also make use of robotics, so robotics experts will also be in high demand, to build, maintain and fix the machines. Machine learning will also make several technologies redundant, as it already has to some extent with traditional chess engines. It can be used in applications like translation, as the machine can learn from mistakes to produce better translations in the future, or even in certain medical tests, by analysing many results, it can match symptoms to illnesses and treatments, and become increasingly accurate at doing so, as it analyses more results. However the medical applications of machine learning are unlikely to happen soon, as people are not likely to trust that the machine will get the correct result, even though it is possible, if not likely that the machine will be more accurate than most doctors.<p>
							<h2>How will this affect you?</h2>
							<p>As an avid chess player, machine learning has already affected how I analyse my games, as the engine I use to analyse games and determine where I, or my opponent, made mistakes, and what the best way to avoid said mistakes is. This is because the engine I use to analyse my games is stockfish 13, which uses an AlphaZero inspired machine learning algorithm as part of its system. However more generally, machine learning will affect my future job prospects, as it will reduce the amount of menial jobs available, meaning that there may be more competition for skilled jobs in the IT sector, in which I am planning on working. This may make it more difficult to get a job, however machine learning will also open up more opportunities in the IT sector, as there will be jobs related to developing, maintaining and fixing machine learning systems available. None of my friends or family work in the IT sector, or work menial jobs, so machine learning is unlikely to affect them in this way. However it may affect them in other ways. Machine learning will start affecting how they interact with technology, such as algorithms finding recommended shows in apps like Netflix, or algorithms finding recommended news articles in news apps. Machine learning will also allow them to speak to their phones, using things like siri and alexa, which will become increasingly effective as machine learning technology advances. Machine learning’s benefits to translation services may also help my mum’s side of the family, as they are all Finnish and many of them do not speak english excellently. Machine learning may help them communicate better with others, as they will be able to translate things into Finnish, or translate their responses, in Finnish, into other languages for others to read.<p>
							<h1>Autonomous vehicles:</h1>
							<h2>What does it do? What technological or other developments make this possible?</h2>
							<p>An autonomous, or self-driving vehicle, is a vehicle that can successfully travel from point A to point B without any input from the passengers, other than the destination. This is achieved by feeding data from sensors such as radar, lidar, gps and odometers to computers which interpret this data and ensure that the vehicle travels safely and accurately to where it is going. The most advanced commercially available semi-autonomous vehicles are Tesla’s cars. Tesla offers a service called autopilot which allows the car to steer, accelerate and brake in a single lane without driver input. However Tesla admits that this is not a full self-driving service, and that it requires driver supervision at all times. Tesla does however claim that all of their cars have all of the necessary sensors and computing power to become fully autonomous, once that is both possible through software updates, and legal. It is difficult to determine how quickly this will happen, as there are many hurdles to jump through legally, as people may not trust the programmed ethics that the computer follows, and said ethics must be programmed and determined in the first place. However it is likely that the software side of autonomous vehicles will progress rapidly in the next few years, with big companies like Tesla, Uber and others putting lots of resources into making it a reality. However it will still take time to create the necessary level of artificial intelligence for a car to understand the chaos of an inner city environment, particularly in places such as India, where there are significantly fewer road laws and less organisation in how people drive. Autonomous vehicles are possible as a result of a significant increase in computer power and portability in the past 20 years, and increasingly accurate and effective sensor and positioning systems such as radar, lidar and gps. These sensors use varying methods such as radio waves, or even light to determine the surroundings of the vehicle at all times, and then gps is used to determine the vehicle’s position on earth, particularly in relation to its destination. This allows the vehicle to map a path to its destination, conforming to pre-loaded maps (which must be frequently updated to ensure accuracy), while maintaining a constant monitor on the cars environment to ensure that it does not crash or go off course. To begin with, autonomous cars would have to allow for regular cars, with human drivers, and therefore would have to have sensors that detect road signs, traffic lights and other road markings. However, as all cars become autonomous, instead of using humanly recognisable road signs, the cars will be able to communicate with each other, which would allow for traffic flow, particularly at intersections, to be optimised, and would remove the need for traffic lights and other road signs. Additionally, if the cars are able to communicate, they would have many additional sensors and points of data to use when determining what to do, as they would be able to use the sensors of other cars to monitor the environment. This would allow for more accurate environmental monitoring for all cars and therefore, for much more accurate decisions to be made. However, there is a downside, as this car to car communication could potentially be hacked, and then the cars could be instructed either to make decisions based on incorrect data, or simply instructed to follow orders that are not suitable in the situation, potentially resulting in dangerous situations. This could be mitigated through the use of encryptions, however it would still be a lingering issue to be kept in mind when using autonomous vehicles.<p>
							<h2>What is the likely impact? </h2>
							<p>The likely impact of autonomous vehicles is to reduce the time spent in focusing on driving to travel. This would allow people to have more time, depending on the length of their regular commutes, to focus on other things, either more time to work, or more leisure time. It will likely become commonplace to read or watch TV or movies, or play video games while commuting, which will result in driving being a much rarer skill. The use of self driving cars would probably result in road based public transport being much rarer, if not completely unseen. This would make redundant the jobs of taxi and bus drivers. However autonomous vehicles would open up entirely new fields of jobs in further upgrading the software used for autonomous driving, and maintaining the sensors and computer systems that are vital to safe and effective autonomous vehicles. Overall, autonomous driving would free up on average, around an hour every day (Liang, M 2019) for people, which could be used to do work that otherwise would not be done until a worker reached the office, to then be able to leave the office earlier, or simply to relax while reading or doing puzzles. This would have a major impact on the lives of most people, I would challenge you to find anyone who would turn down an extra hour of free time. Additionally, the optimised traffic flow that would be possible with autonomous vehicles, as well as the potential for increased speed limits would shorten commute times, allowing people to spend less time traveling and more time at home. Autonomous vehicles would also have a major impact on the shipping industry, as autonomous trucks could be set to repeat certain routes over and over on a specific timetable, removing the need for truck drivers, and increasing shipping efficiency, therefore lowering postage costs for the end user. <p>
							<h2>How will this affect you? </h2>
							<p>This will affect me as it will change how I travel. Instead of taking the train to get to RMIT, maybe I will be able to relish the privacy afforded by a car instead of using a public train. Additionally, when I want to go anywhere else, I won’t have to put effort into driving, I will simply be able to tell the car where I want to go and relax. However it will likely affect my family significantly more than it will affect me, as my dad spends around 2 hours almost every day commuting to his work in the city. A self-driving car would allow him to not have to focus on the extreme traffic on the way to, and in Melbourne, and he would be able to relax before starting work. Furthermore, an autonomous vehicle would be able to simply drive itself to pick up my sisters from their various schools, saving my mum time and making it easier for my sisters to be more independent. It would also be easier for friends, particularly ones without drivers licenses	 to visit my house, or to go out somewhere with them, or for me to go to their house, particularly if they live further away than would be comfortable to walk. Additionally, due to the current global pandemic, my household has grown increasingly reliant on ordering things online and having them shipped and this is a habit that is likely to persist well after the end of the pandemic. Therefore it would be very nice if the potential shipping cost savings that could be a result of widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles could come into effect. However, I particularly enjoy the idea of a fast car and am a huge fan of motorsport, both of which are things that could be negatively impacted by self driving cars, as less people would learn to drive and therefore there would be less racing drivers, and what is the point of a fast car when the car drives itself at the same speed as every other car. <p>
							<h1>Robots</h1>
							<h2>What does it do? What technological or other developments make this possible?</h2>
							<p>A robot is a machine that can perform an action. This could be something as simple as a robotic arm that lifts something from one conveyor belt to another in a factory, to something as complicated as an artificially intelligent android. There are several different types of robots commonly used in the modern day, including industrial robots, which are used to manufacture and manipulate things in industrial settings. This also includes things like the sorting robots used by Amazon and other companies in their warehouses. Robots also have military and police applications as they are disposable. This means that they can be used to disarm bombs or attempt to take down targets with weapons that could otherwise hurt humans. There are also a small, increasing amount, of domestic robots, things like the Roomba vacuum, which make everyday life slightly easier. There are also robots designed to make life easier for the elderly and disabled, such as electric wheelchairs with the ability to call for help if the occupant has a seizure or some other medical emergency. These kinds of robots have become possible as a result of increasingly advanced mechanical and electronic hinges and pistons, increasing computer power and increasingly advanced and effective software that can be used to control the robots. In the future, robots are likely to become even more complicated and effective at completing either single and multiple tasks. There are already examples of robots that use machine learning and artificial intelligence to attempt to mimic humans, and this resemblance will only become more pronounced as machine learning and artificial intelligence become increasingly advanced. An example of this is the robot known as ‘Sophia’, a humanoid robot that has some artificial intelligence, enough to hold a conversation, at least briefly, and is able to recognise faces. It is particularly important that machine learning is advanced, as without it robots will be unable to learn things independently, and would have to be programmed specifically for every task that they are intended to achieve. However, a robot that can learn new tasks would be far more effective, as each individual task that it is intended for would not have to be coded, allowing the robot to be independent and effective. However, simpler domestic robots are also likely to become more common and more effective, for example a robot that can cook meals, or wash dishes. The majority of this innovation will be as a result of increasingly effective software, as the hardware is almost completely adequate for this to be achieved now. There may be some increases required to the precision of the hardware, especially if the robot is cooking as fire is not something to be inaccurate around. Robots are also likely to be used in space exploration, as they are much more suited to the zero gravity vacuum of space than humans are. An example of this that is already in operation is the Canadarm, a long robotic arm that was used to manipulate space shuttle payloads from 1981 to 2011. Upgraded versions of the Canadarm system are used on the International Space Station, to conduct experiments, repair things and even to originally build the modular space station. In the future, Canadarm3, an even more advanced version of Canadarm will be used in the Gateway lunar outpost, to repair it, dock with vehicles to ensure that they do not float away in the low gravity, relocate the base if and when necessary and assist astronauts during EVAs (extra-vehicular-activities). This will allow human spaceflight to advance, highlighting just how necessary robots will become in the future.<p>
							<h2>What is the likely impact? </h2>
							<p>Robots have the potential to have a huge impact on society. They have already replaced many factory jobs, such as in the automotive industry, and this is unlikely to stop. Robots don’t get tired as humans do, and can maintain the same level of efficiency day in, day out. This makes them much more effective than humans at menial tasks, and therefore these kinds of jobs, in manufacturing or warehouse jobs, are likely to be replaced first. The people who are affected by this will need to learn new skills that will be more useful in a world where robots are able to perform all of our necessary menial tasks. However robots will create new jobs, such as maintenance of the robots and programming of new robots. Furthermore, newer robots will replace older, less efficient ones, and therefore companies will be in a constant race to keep up to date and use the newest robots, to maintain peak efficiency. This will also create new jobs in recycling older robots to minimise waste, and will also create jobs in workflow planning, for people to determine which combinations of robots are most effective for that company's particular needs. Robotics will also attract engineers to design new robots that are stronger, more dexterous and simply more advanced than previous designs, and will therefore attract investors to finance these new designs. Robots will also enhance the ability of humans to explore space, and even the depths of earth's oceans, which are as yet unexplored. This is because robots are inherently more suited to these kinds of environments that humans are, not requiring oxygen to operate, and being able to operate in much wider temperature ranges. This means that robots have the potential to influence scientific discovery in many different shapes, which could affect more and more areas of life, further increasing the impact of robotics on human life.<p>
							<h2>How will this affect you? </h2>
							<p>Robots are likely to affect me by making my life somewhat easier. They will be able to cut out menial tasks, such as vacuuming, giving me more time to do things that I enjoy or am interested in. This is likely how they will affect my friends and family, although it may take somewhat longer for members of my family who are older to become accepting of robots, as they are much more used to doing menial tasks day in, day out. These kinds of domestic robots will be a big help to my mum, who does the majority of the menial tasks such as cooking and cleaning, as my dad works full time. Furthermore, as more and more manufacturing is done by robots, it will become cheaper to manufacture goods. This means that my family, friends and I will be able to access goods that may have previously been too expensive as a result of an expensive manufacturing process. Furthermore, as I am looking to get a job in IT in the future, there may be more jobs for me to potentially choose from, as jobs will open up in the fields of programming robots. However there may also be more competition for these jobs, as there will be more people who have gained the skills to work with robots after having potentially had old, less skilled jobs, taken by robots. This may make it more difficult for me to get a job, as there will potentially be competition across all fields of IT from people who have learned new skills after having had their older jobs taken by robots. Robots will also create new jobs that I could potentially apply for around data science, as with many robots being used for a variety of tasks, there will be a lot of potential data that could be analysed to find new ways to increase efficiency, or new ways to automate tasks that result in optimised workflows.<p>
							<h1>Cyber Security-Blockchain</h1>
							<h2>What does it do?</h2>
							<p>A component of cyber security that has become prevalent amongst many companies and corporations is a technology known as blockchain. Blockchain is one of the most secure forms of cyber security technology to date, this technology is a “distributed and decentralised ledger system that can record transactions between multiple computers”. Meaning that blockchain fully automates data storage to minimise the effect of human error, which is the leading cause of data breaches. In terms of cybersecurity, it can be used in any industry as any transaction can be inserted into blockchain and indicate the transaction integrity, conveying if any transactions are being used for a cyber-attack. Blockchain is a database that stores data in ‘blocks’ that are connected together, by making the data decentralised it means that no single user or industry has control over the data and the data is completely irreversible, permanent and open to the public. Once a block is full, a new one is created and connected to the previous block which means that data is attached together in chronological order as they are given a time stamp. If a hacker alters their block chain it would no longer be consistent with everyone else’s block chains and would be considered criminal. If a hacker wanted gain control over the block chain, they must alter 51% of the blockchain copies simultaneously to trick the system into believing that their copy is the correct one, which would be almost impossible.</p>
							<p>If blockchain development continues there can be an endless number of possibilities for cyber security advances using block chain. Social media is a major part of almost everyone’s life and is going to continue to grow immensely as the hold of the digital age continues to impact the world. With the growth of social media, there is the inevitable threat of cybersecurity attacks, companies such as Twitter and Facebook have faced breaches that have compromised millions of people’s data. To combat this threat, block chain technology can be introduced to secure people’s data to allow safe and secure private messaging.  This will allow users data to stay protected from cyber-attacks and it being decentralised means that the data isn’t in a single centralised location.</p>
							<p>A threat that many companies and people face are Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, which is when a network resource is targeted such as a website or server to disrupt the services of a host connected to the internet by flooding a network with an immense amount of traffic so it  can no longer operate. A domain name system (DNS) is a centralised point for computers to connect to, making it the perfect target for a DDoS attack. If block chain were to be introduced to decentralise the DNS entries, it will remove the centralised vulnerable point that a hacker would target.</p>
							<h2>The development of blockchain was made possible by 3 major technologies:</h2>
							<p>The first being cryptographic keys, which are to keys a private and public that help perform secure transactions between two parties. Each party had these keys to produce a digital signature that is used to authorize transaction to another entity. This is arguably the most important aspect of blockchain<p>
							<p>The second being a peer to peer (P2P) network; a network that does not require a server or separate computer to share resources. Block chain users utilize crypto keys, creating a digital signature, to perform many different interactions over a P2P network. Allowing for safe and secure interactions.<p>
							<p>Lastly, is simply the technological progress to be able to store data and the transactions of user digital by creating massive databases of user data. Without this massive technological advancement, there would be no reason for blockchain to ever exist.</p>
							<h2>What is the likely impact?</h2>
							<p>The biggest impact of Blockchain will be the increased trust people with data storage systems as Blockchain has a high level of transparency and traceability. This system has the potential to impact all data storage processes, changing the outlook on how data should be stored. It is common practice that the data is to be held by one person or company but Blockchain completely reverses that concept has it decentralises all the data, so the responsibility of data isn’t held by one corporation but rather by the public. This can impact every industry, as data protection is one of the biggest concerns amongst any company with a large digital presence as they hold the personal information of the public on their shoulders. This affects everyone, as it is everyone’s data that will be protected not just private corporations and companies and if this technology is further developed in may help with protection against many other forms of attacks such as DDoS attacks.</p>
							<p> Currently it is hard to say what jobs will be affected by Blockchain, as the technology still has a long way to go, but we can theorise that jobs that involve public record keeping may become redundant as there is a push to make identities represented on blockchain. Furthermore, smart contracts are being developed from Blockchain technology, they are basically a digital contract that automatically triggers an action if certain conditions are met, which may completely reduce the need for paperwork making many jobs redundant. But in saying that, many jobs will be created from blockchain as it will effect markets such as finance, marketing and sales which means many roles will change to help a company grow but under a system using blockchain.</p>
							<h2>How will this affect you?</h2>
							<p>The greatest part about this software is that It won’t have a massive impact on my day-to-day life as I can continue to do everything I would usually do online such as accessing social media, online banking and playing video games but my data will be more protected as I do these things. I major effect I will have is that I will know in the back of my mind that my data is more secure and that one entity does not exclusively hold my data as it is decentralised. </p>
							<p>What will be different for me is that I could use more mainstream social media networks such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter for private messaging knowing that my data stored securely. I won’t have to rely on these almost unknown messaging applications such as Signal that provide encrypted messaging. If my data is stored using blockchain, I can worry less about the threat of hackers stealing my data from these massive corporate entities that we rely so heavily on to keep us protected.</p>
							<p>All of my friends and family will be effected by this as there data is stored in one way or another, mainly using social media applications. Most of them will likely not realise that this is effecting them or that blockchain even exists. None the less, their data will be more secure through the decentralisation method that blockchain uses.</p>
