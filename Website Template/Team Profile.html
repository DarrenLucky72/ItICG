							<h2>Personal Information</h2>
							<h2>Personality Tests</h2>
							<p>The following are results three different personality test taken by each of the group member.They're a reflection of the groups components and serves as information on how the group balances of eachother.</p>
							<p>From the Myers Briggs Type Indicator, almost every outcome of the test resulted in a different personality just a couple carried similar personality trait being differentiated by only a single indicator.Looking at each attribute, Each type indicated by a letter has an even spread .The balance between extraverted and introverted ensures that group members can work both in groups and individually,not heavily favoring only one way.Not having an over reliance on an individual or smaller group also helps in managing team meetings as the balance makes groups meetings more efficient all the while having individual work be effective.There's also an even amount of the attribute intuitive and observant .Having both intuitive and Observant traits means that with information gathered,the team can not only imagine future potential with the use of the information given,but also have it be practical and with that members of the team can use eachothers prespective to maximize the result for the group,not keeping things too narrow minded .One of the attribute that leaned more on one side is the feeling attribute,compared to its counterpart the thinking attribute.The feeling trait means that the group makes decisions more based on personal values. The team would more likely approach a particular problem while considering its impact on people first.Though it is a great trait to have, having less dependency on logic might result in team choices that comes as more irrational and emotional.Similar to the previous attribute, the prospecting trait is much more apparent in the group,with every member having the trait ,contrast to the judging trait.The group is more flexible on dealing with decisions and unprecedented challenges.The trait however leads to more carefree attitude and leaves decision making on impulse,which could be bad for the team if left unaccounted for.While having an uneven result on some of the trait might leave blind spots, it is valuable to know the strengths and weaknesses of the team so moving forward the group can minimize the flaws and capitalize on the positives for a greater outcome.</p>
							<p>The groups learning style is varied,leaning on an activist style.This means a more hands on approach,learning by doing and having an open mind upon experiencing new things.The group is also able to learn in a reflector way,observing and thinking about what happened ,reviewing the events that happened after invloving themselves on a first hand.Both learning syle is especially good for work in teams, as both excell with multiple people willing to help.The group learns well and would gain a lot of information from problem solving and group discussion,aswell as feedback from one another.The group also has a higher preference on learning visually.This could work well for the group as it lets the team visualize decisions easily and could make the team understand new concepts better with images and keywords.</p>
							<p>From the big 5 personality test, The group has a higher affinity on aggreeableness. The team is optimstic and puts others' needs above their own,prioritizing cooperation.This makes sure each member is not left behind and that is great for the workflow of the team as it lets every individual do their parts to their best capabilities.the group also scores high on the intellect ,letting the group think in a more abstract and imaginative way,great in a group setting where ideas with a lot of potential can be crucial to a group success.The group does not excell at Conscientiousness however ,which could bring the team down as it leaves the team more disorganized,impuls reliant, and easily sidetracted.</p>
							<p>These are the analysis of the group's tests and understanding the results is detrimental to a groups long term accomplishment.These results are not set in stone and knowing each members strenght and weaknesses,along with the group's will improve the way the team works .Knowing what to avoid and the things that can be helpful for the group will in the end improve work quality and efficiency,resulting in a more desirable outcome. Team members can have either complementary or contrasting personalities,combining different views and prespectives, along with sharing experiences on how members handle obstacles and problems in front of them will in the end better teamwork, communication , and trust .</p>
