							<h1>IT Work</h1>
							<b><h2>What Kind of work is done by the IT Professional?</h2></b>
							<p>The IT professional that was interviewed was a software engineering named Robert Jackson, he obtained a Bachelor of Software Engineering at the Charles Darwin University in Darwin, Northern Territory. He job entails him doing net development work for the Northern Territory (NT) government. Jackson believed his work on the covid tracking system, which he is currently working on, is a great example of software development that captures the essence of his work. Jackson has been doing full stack development for the covid system to track border entries into the NT tracking entries via plane, car, rail and more. He explained that full stack development is when a team works throughout the whole development of a project, both the backend and frontend work. </p>
							<p>When working on the back end of a project he uses code and software such as JavaScript, Aurelia for the frame working and .NET development. He also uses programs such as Angular for application design frameworks, React for building user-interfaces and SQL for database work. A lot of the front end work is developed with code like HTML, CSS and C Sharp (C#). </p>
							<b><h2>What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with?</h2></b>
							<p>Jackson works in a small-knit team, that “literally work three metres from each other”, that only consists of three other people such as a another software developer, project manager and a business analyst. The business analyst’s job is to meet and communicate with the client about mainly the front-end work of a project. Gathering information such as how the client wants the layout, font, colour and other aesthetic details of an application or website. The business analyst then creates a ticket via Jira, a project tracking and development software, containing the information from the client. Jackson occasionally meets with the client himself, but he said that mainly “the business manager handles this side of the project.”</p>
							<p>Recently, Jackson was able to meet with the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, Michael Gunner, discussing his work on the covid tracking system that he has been developing. But this is just a rare event due to the current climate of the world with the pandemic effecting the Northern Territory.  </p>
							<b><h2>Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?</h2></b>
							<p>Robert Jackson spends most of his time in his office working with his small team on various projects for the government. He stated that the front-end stage of development was the most time consuming as he contains a lot of back and forth with the client discussing any changes with the project. There are many situations when the client wants a certain feature added but then after development decides that they want it removed or changed. So, it can be a very slow process that contains of lot of patience and clear communication with the client. </p>
							<b><h2>What aspect of their position is most challenging?</h2></b>
							<p>While interviewing Robert Jackson, he was mentioning how it can be hard to gain motivation when working on the front-end stage, as a lot of the work tends to be very tedious and repetitive. He gave a great example with working on the covid tracking system, he had created 4 columns on a page filled with information and he was then told he had to add an extra column which meant he had to begin just copy and pasting the lines of code for the previous columns in a very slow and monotonous process.  This aspect of his work is necessary but lacks the creative component of software development that is very exciting and engaging.  </p>
