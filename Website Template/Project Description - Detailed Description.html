							<p>No, my opinion to pursue the career of Video Game Developer has not changed as a result of looking at the Burning Glass data.</p>
							
							<h3>Why or why not?</h3>
							<p>This is because even if there is a higher quantity of demand from employers for other jobs and or fields, many do not apply to me, I do not have much desire to pursue other fields, at most, I may experiment with other fields, but I don’t have the desire to change my occupational future as a result of them.</p>
