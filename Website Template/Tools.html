							<p>For creating the website for the game, we used this application called Phantom. We chose this website, as we think the website’s template is perfect for showcasing our game, it’s features, the references and so on. As for designing the application, the designer will be using “Piskelapp” and in “Piskelapp”, the design team was able to create sprites, as well as, designing the enemies , as well as, their animations and their characters. For the combat of the game, we are going to be using Python, as a lot of us have some experience with Python due to previous experience, so using Python will be a good programming software for our game. Because our game requires physical data from the user, it will be a good idea to collaborate with some health applications to track the user’s heart rate, the calories burnt and many more. A good application is Accuro health and according to the website, we can be able to get watches that can track the user’s heart rate and more, instead of doing it on the phone and they offer free demos, as well. For creating the music for our game, we are gonna be using a software called Bandlab. Although, the music will be quite a small part of our game. We still want to include it during the combat part of the game. We will be using a UI software development kit called Figma and because a lot of us are familiar with the application due to previous experience, it will be a lot easier for us to use Figma for creating the UI or the user interface for our game. For communication with each of the members, we are using a mix between Discord and Microsoft Teams. Discord, because we think that Discord is a really good platform for exchanging messages between us and Microsoft Teams, primarily because of recording our meetings, where we talk about group updates, combat scenarios and many more.</p>
