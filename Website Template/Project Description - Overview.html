							<p> Life Quest is an AR RPG that draws inspiration from games like Pokémon Go and Ingress, these games allow the player to take the game to the real world, Pokémon Go allows the user to live their childhood dreams as a Pokémon trainer by exploring the world in the search of Pokémon. The game allows this by randomly spawning Pokémon around the world, which the user can then find and try to capture. Life Quest is similar in the way that we have random quests and encounters that will spawn around the world, that players can choose to accept or decline. Pokémon Go also has a feature called poke stops which are pre-selected key points where the user can collect a variety of random rewards such as different types of poke balls and food to help catch Pokémon. Similarly, Life Quest has implemented merchants/shops that are not randomly allocated but based on popular hotspots around the world. An example, If you live in Melbourne, a shop could be at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) which allows the user to repair or upgrade their armour and by health and mana potions. What separates Pokémon Go and Life Quest is the quests that focus on exercise, many of Life Quest’s quests will be focused on allowing the user to become more active, of course, it will be within reason and measurable, so the player will not be expected to get on the ground a begin doing push-ups but rather they may need to walk to a certain landmark within a time limit. </p>
							<p>Another massive component of Life Quest is that it is a Role Player Game, some similar games are Final Fantasy, Elder Scrolls Online (ESO) and World of Warcraft(WoW). Life Quest’s battle scenarios are most similar to Final Fantasy <img src="images/ff.PNG" ALIGN="right" /> as it is a turn-based concept that allows the player to choose an attack and their target, then the scenario unfolds showing the damage the player dealt and the damage done to them. Whereas games like ESO and WoW use an active style of combat (Figure 2)  as the player can run using W,A,S,D, use abilities by pressing the number keys and use the mouse for aiming. This method was not realistic for a mobile game, as it would be extremely difficult and uncomfortable to do without a keyboard and mouse. Also, a mobile phone would not be able to run a massive open-world game like WoW or ESO. A huge part of MMORPG’S (Mass Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games) are gear and weapon sets, all three games above include some sort of gear sets. A gear set is a unique style of armour that when all the pieces are equipped give the player a boost in a certain stat based on the type of gear set. ESO does a great and simple way of accomplishing practical use of gear sets, an example (Figure 3) is the Arch-Mage gear set, when a player has all 5 pieces of armour equipped they get increased magicka recovery and other stats when they have 2, 3 and 4 pieces equipped. This style of gear sets would likely be the most applicable to life quest as it is rather simple and easy to understand.</p>
