							<p> Overall, this group worked well together. There were no disagreements, and everyone successfully completed their assigned tasks on time. Furthermore, everyone contributed during meetings. However one issue was that not everyone was always on time for meetings, sometimes due to unforeseen circumstances, such as power outages, but sometimes simply because they forgot or slept through an alarm. This could be improved by increasing the number of reminders sent for meetings and perhaps scheduling them at times that more suited everyone, however this would have been difficult to do, due to some members of the group living in different timezones. It was surprising how quickly this group could achieve tasks when working together, for example, everyone helped complete the project idea, as it was a difficult thing for any one person to do, and it was completed very very quickly and effectively. I learned that groups are a very effective way of completing large tasks very quickly, as making a website, particularly one with multiple pages, is not a particularly easy task to complete quickly even when using a template. However this group managed to do this within a week, much quicker than I would have otherwise expected, because everyone helped and did their part of the website efficiently and effectively. </p>
