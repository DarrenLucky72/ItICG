							<h3>Oscar</h3>
							<p> I believe the group assessment went very well, the group was very good at quickly assigning roles and sticking to dates we would set to get the content done, they all seemed to not want to let the group down. Although, something that can be improved is communication for attending meetings, for the most part it was very good, but there were occasions when group members suddenly did not attend or communicate why they could not attend. An aspect that surprised me was that the group was very willing to accept a new member mid-way through the assignment, I genuinely knew I had a great group from that point on! (They were still great before!). The major thing I have learn about groups is that communication is key, that includes asking for help, informing what progress you have made and telling the group about any things that might get in the way of you doing work. If you communicate you can work through any problems that might appear but if they are kept a secret, it may make your group crumble. Overall, this group has been very dedicated and hardworking, making it a fantastic group experience. </p>

							<p>Ultimately, this group worked well together, we were able to freely discuss any changes we wanted made without feeling left out, we had a great relationship across the three weeks and learnt how to properly conduct ourselves not only in our meetings, but in our work ethic. Another thing that went great for our group is how efficiently well we worked together, we created deadlines for our individual parts and we respected them greatly by adhering to our deadlines. The only way that my experience could have been improved would be for the group to have a deeper understanding for the time zone differences group members exhibited or for us to follow meeting times better, I apply to this as I have a track record for being a couple or a handful of minutes late to the meetings, the silver lining to this is that the group is always sympathetic when members apologise for being late. The thing I found most surprising about the group was how receptive they were to othersâ€™ ideas, they usually enjoy the idea, which is something I was not used to in past group projects. The grand lesson I learnt about groups from this assignment was to expect the unexpected and not to rely on past ideas about the archetypes project groups can sometimes follow.</p>

							<p> Overall, this group worked well together. There were no disagreements, and everyone successfully completed their assigned tasks on time. Furthermore, everyone contributed during meetings. However one issue was that not everyone was always on time for meetings, sometimes due to unforeseen circumstances, such as power outages, but sometimes simply because they forgot or slept through an alarm. This could be improved by increasing the number of reminders sent for meetings and perhaps scheduling them at times that more suited everyone, however this would have been difficult to do, due to some members of the group living in different timezones. It was surprising how quickly this group could achieve tasks when working together, for example, everyone helped complete the project idea, as it was a difficult thing for any one person to do, and it was completed very very quickly and effectively. I learned that groups are a very effective way of completing large tasks very quickly, as making a website, particularly one with multiple pages, is not a particularly easy task to complete quickly even when using a template. However this group managed to do this within a week, much quicker than I would have otherwise expected, because everyone helped and did their part of the website efficiently and effectively. </p>
