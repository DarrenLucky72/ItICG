							<h1>Reflections</h1>
							<h2> Individual reflections </h2>
							<h3>Oscar</h3>
							<p> I believe the group assessment went very well, the group was very good at quickly assigning roles and sticking to dates we would set to get the content done, they all seemed to not want to let the group down. Although, something that can be improved is communication for attending meetings, for the most part it was very good, but there were occasions when group members suddenly did not attend or communicate why they could not attend. An aspect that surprised me was that the group was very willing to accept a new member mid-way through the assignment, I genuinely knew I had a great group from that point on! (They were still great before!). The major thing I have learn about groups is that communication is key, that includes asking for help, informing what progress you have made and telling the group about any things that might get in the way of you doing work. If you communicate you can work through any problems that might appear but if they are kept a secret, it may make your group crumble. Overall, this group has been very dedicated and hardworking, making it a fantastic group experience. </p>
							<h3>James</h3>
							<p>Ultimately, this group worked well together, we were able to freely discuss any changes we wanted made without feeling left out, we had a great relationship across the three weeks and learnt how to properly conduct ourselves not only in our meetings, but in our work ethic. Another thing that went great for our group is how efficiently well we worked together, we created deadlines for our individual parts and we respected them greatly by adhering to our deadlines. The only way that my experience could have been improved would be for the group to have a deeper understanding for the time zone differences group members exhibited or for us to follow meeting times better, I apply to this as I have a track record for being a couple or a handful of minutes late to the meetings, the silver lining to this is that the group is always sympathetic when members apologise for being late. The thing I found most surprising about the group was how receptive they were to others’ ideas, they usually enjoy the idea, which is something I was not used to in past group projects. The grand lesson I learnt about groups from this assignment was to expect the unexpected and not to rely on past ideas about the archetypes project groups can sometimes follow.</p>
							<h3>Darren</h3>
							<p>From my experience with this group, I had a very positive experience with this group. Everyone in the group got together very well, even though for me, this is the very first time I met these people and have never talked with them at all. Another thing that went rather well is that everyone in the group managed to get all the things done in time, even Mark, who is new in the group, managed to get all his things done in time, which is very impressive. My only slight complaint with the group was that some of the member’s volume was very low and I had a quite challenging time hearing them and I had to use my earphones to hear them, so I think that could be improved if possible. Another slight complaint I would say is that some of us’ video for recordings didn’t work and we had to wait for a while for it, so I think that could also be improved if possible. Besides those slight issues, I had a very positive time with this group and that for me was very surprising, because I honestly thought that I might not really get along with the group, but to my surprise, everyone was very kind and generous and whenever, one person has an issue, one of us tries to help and I learned a lot about creating websites thanks to this group, because that is one thing I had issues with during my first assignment and I had a quite a challenging time with it and thanks to this group, I now understand how to create a website and as well as, the importance of clicking with everybody else and if I don’t click with the group, then I might have a very different time with the group.</p>
							<h3>Mark</h3>
							<p>All things considered ,the group worked splendidly with each other.I joined the group midway and everyone was very welcoming and the group never really left anyone out.The group had great synergy and everyone worked well on both group work and individual work, staying to the agreed deadlines and keeping things efficient.The group was very open minded on new ideas and the group had great communication,at least in my perspective. I had a great time working with the team. One thing that could be tweaked is that some minor things that are agreed upon in meetings are not immediately realized.This is not a major inconvenience but something that could be worked on for future work so work doesn't get pushed back too far.I also found it surprising is how flexible the group when handling upcoming work. Especially when i joined the group,everyone kept an open schedule and adjusted very well.The amount of work was spread evenly and i was given a fair amount to work on.I was neither left out nor overwhelmed with too much that i can't keep up.The thing i got from working is group is that our individual work affects the whole group and each members has their own responsibilities to make sure that they not only complete their individual part,but also actively contribute in group work and discussions. </p>
							<h3>Kenneth</h3>
							<p> The group was able to collectively work together effectively and make decisions unanimously, whether that be deciding deadlines or accepting a new member; the result of a positive mesh of personalities or just a desire to do well in the assessment. Disagreements were minor and of no consequence to the group, such as deciding optimal meeting times, which is to be expected given the situation with people living with different time zones. Surprisingly, despite the time zone difference, we as a group managed to still find time to come together at least twice a week, more than I can say for a different group project for another subject, which is an improvement in my eyes. What could be improved on would be the quality and preparation of the meetings we had. </p>
							<p> Regarding quality: most people’s microphones were on when they had nothing to say, which would not be a problem if not for the background noise sometimes coming through. Albeit somewhat minor it was distracting, especially if it went on for an extended time and the person was oblivious to not only said background noise but continued to keep it that way despite implicit and explicit messages, even in later meetings. This would be solved if we just muted when we had nothing to say, and at the press of a button speak when appropriate. </p>
							<p> Regarding preparation: it was only later on in the assessment, about a week or two before it was due, that we were told (read: we missed it in the specification somehow) an agenda had to be written up before a meeting was to take place. Up until then we had only informally brought up expectations, assignment roles and due dates. However effective said process may have been at the time, an agenda would have been helpful in providing us a solid direction plan and something to refer to during meetings.</p>
							<p>Over the course of this assessment, I learnt that I have much to improve on regarding my communication, whether that be progress reporting down to the minor details rather than just ‘I finished my part’ and be willing to accept help in a group project than to shoulder the work of my own volition for the sake of it (making the whole final report because it should be pretty and neat). Working in groups requires a different mindset to the individualistic, role assigning one I have experienced thus far in terms of group projects. </p>
							<h3>Josh</h3>
							<p> Overall, this group worked well together. There were no disagreements, and everyone successfully completed their assigned tasks on time. Furthermore, everyone contributed during meetings. However one issue was that not everyone was always on time for meetings, sometimes due to unforeseen circumstances, such as power outages, but sometimes simply because they forgot or slept through an alarm. This could be improved by increasing the number of reminders sent for meetings and perhaps scheduling them at times that more suited everyone, however this would have been difficult to do, due to some members of the group living in different timezones. It was surprising how quickly this group could achieve tasks when working together, for example, everyone helped complete the project idea, as it was a difficult thing for any one person to do, and it was completed very very quickly and effectively. I learned that groups are a very effective way of completing large tasks very quickly, as making a website, particularly one with multiple pages, is not a particularly easy task to complete quickly even when using a template. However this group managed to do this within a week, much quicker than I would have otherwise expected, because everyone helped and did their part of the website efficiently and effectively. </p>
							<h2> Group Reflection </h2>
							<p> The group discussed that we are very pleased how everyone was able to efficiently manage their time and complete their work by the deadlines that were set. A major point that was brought up, was that everyone participated a lot during discussion, and we strived to make sure that no one was left out. Especially for Mark, as he joined mid-way through the assessment piece, the group was quick to get him involved in the work and discussions. We tried our best to quickly catch him up on the project idea and the work that had been done thus far. Mainly what worked well was that everyone clicked with each other and supported one another throughout the assessment period. </p>
							<p>We all agree that communication could have been better, as there were occasions when group members did not attend meetings and or came late to them. Also, at times there were many hardware problems before the meetings, such as cameras and mics not working, at times we should have been more prepared when coming into meetings, double checking all our equipment is working beforehand.</p>
							<p>There were many surprising aspects with this group, one of the mains ones being the acceptance of a new member within the group, Mark, as taking a new member mid way through the assignment can be risky as we don’t know his level of commitment and dedication to the work. Despite all this, we helped a fellow peer who was in a dire situation and none of us regret it, he has been a great member to the group. Another surprising aspect was how receptive all the group members were to taking on new roles and respecting each others ideas within the project idea. Also, a surprising element was that all the members were able to get their tasks on time, as managing six people can be a struggle especially considering time zone differences, but everyone managed to stay committed to the deadlines.</p>
							<p>This was a learning experience for all of us, we all learnt that communication is key to a successful group, no matter how small the problem, it  can grow out of control if it is not brought to the attention of all the members. Furthermore, as a group, you are not just responsible for yourself but all the members within your group as if one person is struggling then everyone is struggling, and we need to work together to solve any problems.</p>
							<p>We do not believe that the github log accurately reflects the groups work on the assignment, as some people slowly add small changes at a time on github meaning that they are given higher representation on the log. Whilst, others work on a private document and add all their additions at once giving them a lower representation on the log. All in all, the group shared the work amongst ourselves equally and if anyone was struggling with their part, we were more than happy to help.</p>
